## International SPL

How do users of the Seattle Public Library engage with other countries and cultures? This project provides a view of the world from Seattle, in the form of an interactive, 3D data visualization based on millions of checkout records from the library between 2005 and 2015.

This visualization is implemented in Processing, and aided by data analysis performed in MySQL and Python. It was conceived and created as part of a course on algorithmic data visualization at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

A detailed description of the process can be found at the UCSB Media Arts & Technology Vis Lab [website](http://vislab.mat.ucsb.edu/2017/p2/KimberlySchlesinger/index.html).

#### Organization

The Processing language implements the visualization/sketch as a Java applet. The Processing code -- including the setup, data import, class definitions, drawing, and interactive controls -- is contained in `.pde` files in the sketch folder `Beads_3DvF`. The supplementary Python data analysis scripts are included as well.
